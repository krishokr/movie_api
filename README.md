# movie_api

Green Dragon Flix is an application that interacts with an API that allows users to store and view data about their favorite movies. The theme is action and adventure, so it focuses on sub-genres within the category (no rom-coms here..). This site allows users a fun and interactive site to "geek out" about their favorite action and adventure movies. 

Objection: To build the server-side component of a movie web application. The web
application will provide users with access to information about different
movies, directors, and genres. Users will be able to sign up, update their
personal information, and create a list of their favorite movies.

In this project, my role was to create and test a REST API that stores information about the users and their favorite movies. This project taught me how to build my own REST API using Node.js through Express for the server code and MongoDB for the database. I also learned how to use third party services such as Atlas to host my database and Heroku to host my site. I also learned how to test endpoints using Postman.
